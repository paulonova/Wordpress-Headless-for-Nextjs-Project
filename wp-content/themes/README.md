# Install Gulp

## Requirement: Install Node Package in your computer. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

=> Install GULP globally using this command: run-> npm uninstall -g gulp (first) then npm install gulp-cli -g

=> It will allow you to use npm command.

## Follow this steps:

- Open the terminal in the theme folder "isobartheme". (In Visual Studio, left click in folder and choose 'open in integrated terminal')
- In the terminal write: 'npm install' and then ENTER
  => It will take a time and install all dependencies in your project.
- A node_modules folder will be created and a package-lock.json file.
- After that in the same terminal you write: 'gulp' and press ENTER.
- Gulp will run and open a browser with a template sajte.
- Gulp will identify any change in SCSS files, Javascript files and PHP files.
- After identifying, Gulp will reload the browser and display the last changes.
  PS: If nothing of this works, try to go back and follow the steps again, maybe you missed something. Otherwise talk to Paulo.
